# Pomme Notes
Latest release: 2.0.3
Updated: 2026-02-02

Pomme Notes is a lightweight, subtle theme designed to harmonize with macOS and iOS environments. It strictly adheres to a "Native+" philosophy: keeping the familiar structure of the default Obsidian interface while introducing organic textures, smoother animations, and a modern "Liquid Glass" aesthetic.

If you enjoy the original Obsidian experience but want it to feel more like a native app—with softer contrast and tactile depth—this theme is for you.

## Features
**Liquid Glass UI**
Flat overlays replaced with translucent, frosted elements that blur the content behind them, adding depth without clutter.
- Glassy Modals & Prompts: Quick Switcher and Settings modals float with a native look & feel. All the input prompts feel at home.
- Floating Status Bar: The status bar is transformed into a centered, floating glass capsule.
- Active Tabs: Subtle glass highlights and shadows distinguish your active workspace.

**Visual Comfort**
Engineered for long-term readability by avoiding harsh extremes.
- Softened Contrast: Avoids pure white (#ffffff) backgrounds and pure black text. Dark mode uses a deep grey (#191919) with soft silver text (#cccccc) to reduce eye strain.
- Harmonized Accents: Blockquotes, highlights, and checkboxes automatically calculate their colors based on your primary accent hue.

**Organic Motion**
The interface feels alive with subtle, non-intrusive animations.
- Smooth Fade-ins: Embedded content (PDFs, images, Canvas minimaps) fades in gently upon loading.
- Menu Dynamics: Context menus scale and slide in, mimicking native OS behavior.
- Pulse Effects: Subtle flashing animations for specific interaction states.

**Mobile Optimized**
Extensive work has been done to ensure the theme feels native on iOS and iPadOS.
- Touch Targets: Larger, friendlier tap targets for file explorers and menus.
- Mobile Glass: The liquid glass effect is optimized for mobile performance, appearing on navigation bars and floating menus.
- Clean Layout: Simplified sidebars and reduced noise on smaller screens.

## Plugin Support
Pomme Notes includes dedicated styling for popular plugins to ensure they fit the theme's aesthetic:
- Dataview: Optimized tables and lists with unnecessary hover animations removed.
- Calendar: Custom grid styling and indicator dots.
- Ink: Improved integration for handwriting and drawing tools.
