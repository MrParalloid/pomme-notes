# Pomme Notes
Latest release: 2.0.2
Updated: 2026-01-25

This is a lightweight subtle theme to harmonize with macOS and iOS environments. It tries to keep close to native Obsidian theme, just adding subtle touches here and there. If you like the original Obsidian experience but what to add a bit of a native feel and some fresh experiences, give it a try.

## Features
- Good looking Liquid Glass elements taiored for Desktop and Mobile flavors separately
- Slightly reduced contrast, avoiding pure white text and backgrounds, or pure black text on white makes this theme easy on your eyes.
- Some smooth animations and smooth fade-ins for embedded content
- Custom accent color are applied throughout the theme, calculating accents for Blockquotes and Highlights.
- Dataview optimizations, including the removal of unnecessary hover animations
- Fine tuned Headings and other elements

## Recommended Settings for Iconize
Add custom rule based on regex to find all non-markdown files and assign a paperclip 📎 icon to them: 

```
^(?!.*\.md$).*
```
This way you'll see all attachments and files marked differently from regular notes and folders.
For .base files introduced in 1.9 you can use this regex:
```
^.*\.(base)$
```
