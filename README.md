# Pomme Notes
Latest release: 1.0.2
Updated: 2025-04-12

This is a lightweight subtle theme to harmonize with macOS and iOS environments.
Some smooth animations are there as well, but not too much, not to drain our batteries.
This theme respects custom accent color and applies it throughout the theme, including links, checkboxes, and even Iconize's default color.

Recommended plugins are:
- Iconize
- Better Search Views
- Daily Note Calendar
