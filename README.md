This is a lightweight subtle theme to harmonize with macOS and iOS environments.
Some smooth animations and smooth fade-ins for embedded PDFs and Images make it look quite pleasing to use.

This theme respects custom accent color and applies it throughout the theme, including links, checkboxes, and even Iconize's default color.

Recommended plugins are:
- Iconize
- Iconic
- Better Search Views

- Zen Mode

## Recommended Settings for Iconize
Add custom rule based on regex to find all non-markdown files and assign a paperclip ðŸ“Ž icon to them: 

```
^(?!.*\.md$).*
```
This way you'll see all attachments and files marked differently from regular notes and folders.
For .base files introduced in 1.9 you can use this regex:
```
^.*\.(base)$
```
