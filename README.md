# Pomme Notes 1.0.1
Latest release: 2025-04-08

This is a lightweight theme to harmonize with macOS and iOS environments.
Some smooth animations are there as well, but not too much, not to drain our batteries.
This theme respects custom accent color and applies it throughout the theme, including links, checkboxes, and even Iconize's default color.
